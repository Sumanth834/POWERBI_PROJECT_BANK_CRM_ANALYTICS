# üè¶ POWERBI_PROJECT_BANK_CRM_ANALYTICS

Objective
To analyze customer behavior, churn trends, and demographic insights to uncover actionable patterns that support customer retention and strategic banking decisions.

# Project Overview
This project delivers a comprehensive Power BI dashboard built on a bank's customer data. It focuses on:
Churn prediction and customer behavior analysis
Demographic segmentation based on geography, gender, credit score, and age
Financial profiling using balance and salary data
Product affinity and credit card usage trends
The analysis combines data modeling, DAX, and storytelling dashboards to surface patterns that help CRM teams reduce churn and enhance engagement strategies.

# Tools & Technologies
Microsoft Power BI ‚Äì Dashboard creation and visual analytics
Power Query ‚Äì Data transformation and cleansing
DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) ‚Äì KPI and metric definitions
SQL (MySQL) ‚Äì Advanced querying, segmentation, and filtering logic
Excel ‚Äì Initial data exploration and mapping

# Key Insights
1. Churn Patterns
Identified a higher churn rate among female customers (25.05%) compared to male customers (15.37%)
Customers with low credit scores and low balance were more likely to churn

2. Customer Segmentation
Segmented customers by credit score into 5 bands: Excellent, Very Good, Good, Fair, Poor
High-churn clusters found in the ‚ÄúFair‚Äù and ‚ÄúPoor‚Äù segments

3. Product Usage & Credit Card Behavior
Customers owning a credit card used more banking products (avg. ~1.53)
Opportunity identified for cross-selling based on product affinity

4. Demographics & Geography
Churn was highest in Germany, especially among customers with 2 or more products
Certain age groups (35‚Äì45) exhibited higher risk for churn
